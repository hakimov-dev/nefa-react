## About this project üë®‚Äçüíª

The NEFA Landing Template is a modern and sleek landing page template created using a combination of React, TypeScript, and Aos (Animate on Scroll) library. It offers a visually appealing and interactive design that is perfect for showcasing products, services, or any other promotional content.

Built with React, the NEFA Landing Template provides a highly flexible and efficient development environment. React's component-based architecture allows for modular and reusable code, making it easy to customize and extend the template according to specific needs. The use of TypeScript adds static typing and enhances code reliability and maintainability.

One of the notable features of the NEFA Landing Template is its integration of the Aos library. Aos enables smooth and eye-catching animations that are triggered as the user scrolls through the page. These animations add a touch of elegance and interactivity, capturing the attention of visitors and creating an engaging browsing experience.

The NEFA Landing Template offers a responsive layout, ensuring that the landing page looks stunning and functions seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. Whether accessed on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, the template automatically adjusts its elements to provide optimal viewing and usability.

In terms of design, the NEFA Landing Template presents a clean and modern aesthetic. It combines a minimalist approach with carefully chosen typography, color schemes, and imagery to create a visually appealing and professional-looking landing page. The template's layout is thoughtfully organized, allowing for easy navigation and highlighting key information or call-to-action sections.

Overall, the NEFA Landing Template provides a powerful foundation for creating captivating landing pages. With its utilization of React, TypeScript, and Aos, it offers a seamless development experience, stunning animations, and a visually appealing design, making it an excellent choice for businesses or individuals looking to make a strong impression with their online presence.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
